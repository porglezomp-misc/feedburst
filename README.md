Feedburst is a tool that presents you your RSS feeds in chunks, according to a policy that you set.

## Configuring

Feedburst is configured with a config file containing all the comics you'd like to read, and policy about when and how you'd like to read them.
Any line that begins with with a `#` will be treated as a comment and ignored.
Entries in that config file look like the following:

```
# A nice friendly comic
"Goodbye to Halos" <http://goodbyetohalos.com/feed/> @ 2 new comics @ overlap 1 comic @ on monday
```

The `"Title"` is whatever title you’d like to display the comic as.
The `<link>` is a link to the RSS feed to pull the comics from.
The `@policy` are rules for when and how you’d like that comic feed to be presented to you.

- `@ # new comic(s)`: Wait for there to be at least # new comics before you see them.
- `@ overlap # comic(s)`: Show the last # comics that you read.
- `@ on monday/tuesday/etc…`: Show the comics once the corresponding day has passed.
- `@ every # day(s)`: Wait at least # days since you last read the comic.

For more features, [see the advanced config section](#advanced-config).

## Config Location

By default, on macOS and Linux, the config file is stored at:

```
~/.config/feedburst/config.feeds
```

and on Windows, it's stored at

```
%AppData%\Feedburst\config.feeds
```

If you want to set a different default location for your config file, you can set the `$FEEDBURST_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.
If you want to use a different config for a single run, then use `--config FILE` on the command line.

## Advanced Config

By default, all of your feeds are stored together.
On macOS and Linux, they're stored at:

```
~/.local/share/feedburst/feeds/
```

On Windows you can find your feeds at:

```
%AppData%\Feedburst\feeds\
```

If you want to store your feeds in a location different from the default, then you have two options.
First, you can override the base path for all of your comics on the command line with `--feeds PATH`.
If you'd like to permanently change the base path, then add a line to your config file

```
root PATH
```

This will store all feeds that come after that line at `PATH`.
You can use as many `root` directives as you want to, and each feed will use whichever was specified most recently.
If you'd like to reset later feeds to be stored at the default location, then just put `feed` on its own on the line.
